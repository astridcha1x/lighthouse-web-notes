# Primitive Data Types

**The six primitive data types and Objects make up the seven fundamental types of JavaScript.**

In JavaScript, values that aren't Objects are known as **primitives**. They are the simplest possible data types your software can have, and are thus considered essential building blocks of data.

There are **six primitive data types**:
* `undefined`
* `null`
* `boolean`
* `string`
* `number`
* `symbol` (introduced in ES6)

**Objects**, including arrays and functions, **have *properties.*** Overall, they are more complex data types.

Almost all primitve types have their equivalent object representations, and it's possible to invoke properties on those primitive types (although the primitives themselvesdo not have properties).

JavaScript performs type coercion on primitive types that turn them into objects, in order to make them act like objects.
